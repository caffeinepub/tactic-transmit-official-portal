# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Adopt the “Open Architecture” masterplan updates by adding an Achievements page, making Connect fully public, and applying premium parallax/UI enhancements across key pages while preserving existing branding and admin security.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the global header navigation labels/items to: Experience (/), The TT-1 Hardware (/product), Leadership (/board), Achievements (/achievements), Connect (/connect), keeping existing glassmorphism styling and existing logo path usage.
- Add a new /achievements page featuring a “Wall of Excellence” Microsoft-style Bento Grid with four milestone tiles using the exact provided titles and descriptions.
- Update /connect to remove login/signup gating and publicly display Direct Contact Registry details alongside the public Messaging Terminal form.
- Update backend access control so public contact info can be fetched without Internet Identity/profile requirements, while keeping admin-only contact update capabilities unchanged.
- Update Messaging Terminal submission flow: continue persisting messages in the backend, then show a user-visible mailto: option to tactic.transmit@gmail.com (prefilled subject/body) and a copy-to-clipboard action; avoid claiming automatic email delivery.
- Enhance the Home (“Experience”) page with a subtle animated/moving grid background and a parallax scrolling feel, while preserving the hero headline exactly and adding the provided Mission line plus the provided Brand Voice quote by Nandhu Krishna Biju.
- Update /product to present the four components as interactive, clickable 3D-style cards that reveal each component’s detailed technical role text on interaction.
- Update /board (“Leadership & Mentorship”) to a text-forward roster (no photos) with 5 entries including “Jeswin Miss | Chief Institutional Mentor” and exact spelling for “Nandhu Krishna Biju | Ad Handler & Brand Strategist,” plus hover-reveal details (with a mobile-friendly alternative).
- Update the global footer to include links (Home, Technical Data, Achievements, Terms of Service), show the two English status indicators, and update the copyright line exactly as provided.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see updated navigation and footer, can browse a new Achievements “Wall of Excellence” page, access Connect contact details without logging in, submit messages with clear mailto/copy actions, and experience upgraded parallax/premium UI on Home and interactive 3D cards on the Product page, while admin access remains protected.
