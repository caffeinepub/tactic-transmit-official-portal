  "summary": "Most requested Open Architecture updates appear implemented: new /achievements route/page, public Connect page with direct contact registry, backend getContactInfo made public while admin updates remain restricted, Messaging Terminal post-submit mailto + copy workflow, home parallax/grid background, interactive product component cards, leadership roster update, and header/footer nav updates. Two notable gaps: Achievements tile text may not match the masterplan exact copy, and footer copyright is not the required fixed 2026 string (it is dynamic).",

      "reason": "The diff shows an Achievements tile set, but since the masterplan exact text is not present in the BuildRequest and the implemented strings are specific, there is no evidence they match the required exact provided copy.",
