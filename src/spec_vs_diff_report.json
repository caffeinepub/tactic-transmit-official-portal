REQ-44 backend access control changes are present for public reads and admin-only mutations plus message submission/retrieval. REQ-43 is only partially evidenced: the UI references the required poster image, but the diff does not show the required static image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, nor clear evidence of the required grid-tile background being used.",
