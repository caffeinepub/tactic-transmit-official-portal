  "summary": "Diff implements a new multi-page routed portal with Home/Product/Board/Connect/Legal pages, adds Messaging Terminal submission hooks, Founders’ Vault gating via Internet Identity + profile (name+email), a logout control, and Legal/IP + Safety Audit content. However, several blueprint requirements that demand exact English text/labels and certain gating/UX details are not evidenced (or appear to differ), and there are unrequested additions (notably a new backend file and footer attribution).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Founders’ Vault includes a button labeled exactly “Access Secure Contact Details”, and when unauthenticated displays exactly: “Sign up to unlock the Tactic Transmit direct contact line.”",
      "reason": "The FoundersVault component is truncated in the diff summary; the required exact CTA label and exact unauthenticated gating message are not visible in the provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "Show the full provided “Automated Network Access Email” subject + body text exactly, with a “Copy” action, and do not claim an email was actually sent.",
      "reason": "The modal includes a custom subject/body that likely does not match the blueprint exactly, uses a “Copy Email” button label (not evidenced as exactly “Copy”), and includes wording that implies an email was received/sent (e.g., “You are receiving this email…”).",

      "reason": "The narrative sentence and the core value descriptions are present but cannot be confirmed to match the blueprint text exactly from the diff summary; the descriptions shown are short phrases that may differ from the required exact copy.",
